Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out [the project release notes section](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki#release-notes) on our wiki.

## Features

*   Create stand-alone Spring applications
    
*   Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
    
*   Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
    
*   Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
    
*   Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
    
*   Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
